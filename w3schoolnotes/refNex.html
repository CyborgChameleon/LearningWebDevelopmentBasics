			<div id="colorDiv">
				<p id="colorFontParagraph"> I set a paragraph within a division box. <br>
				I've set the background color of the division box to red using rgba value [rgba(255,0,0,1)],<br>
				I've also used hex value to set the border color to green [#00ff00]<br>
				Since I set the paragragh background color blue using hsla value [hsla(240,100%,50%,.5)]<br>
				and the background color behing the paragraph is red <br>
				the result should be purple box within a red box <br>

				and the size to be 125%
